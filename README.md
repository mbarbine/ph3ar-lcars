```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lcars-nuxt-app.git
cd lcars-nuxt-app
```

## Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Create a .env file in the root directory with the following content:

```env
NUXT_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Running Tests
This project includes unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.

Run all tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

Run unit tests:

```bash
npm run test:unit
```

Run integration tests:

```bash
npm run test:integration
```

Run end-to-end tests:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

Deployment
Deploy the application to Vercel:

```bash
vercel --prod
```
Navigate to the `pages/` directory and create a new Vue file with the name of your page, for example, `newpage.vue`.
Adding a New Vue Page
To add a new Vue page to your LCARS Nuxt.js application, follow these steps:
Run the following command to create a new Vue file for your page:
Create the Page File:

Navigate to the pages/ directory and create a new Vue file with the name of your page, e.g., newpage.vue.

Inside the `newpage.vue` file, use the following template:
touch pages/newpage.vue
```

Add Page Content:

Inside the newpage.vue file, use the following template:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <LcarsHeader title="New Page" />
    <LcarsSection>
      <p>Welcome to the new page!</p>
    </LcarsSection>
Start your development server by running the following command:
</template>
```

Access Your New Page:

Start your development server (npm run dev), and navigate to http://localhost:3000/newpage to view your new page.

Creating a New Component
To create a new Vue component and integrate it into your LCARS Nuxt.js application, follow these steps:

Create the Component File:

Navigate to the components/ directory and create a new Vue file within the appropriate subdirectory, e.g., components/UI/NewComponent.vue.

```bash
touch components/UI/NewComponent.vue
```

Add Component Logic:

Inside the NewComponent.vue file, use the following template:

```vue
<template>
  <div class="lcars-panel">
    <slot></slot>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
const props = defineProps({
  variant: {
    type: String,
    default: 'primary',
  },
});
</script>

<style scoped>
.lcars-panel {
  @apply p-4 rounded-lg mb-4 bg-lcarsPrimary text-white;
}
</style>
```

Update Sidebar or Layout to Include the New Component:

If you want to integrate this new component into the Sidebar or another part of your application, update the relevant Vue file:

Example: Update Sidebar.vue:

```vue
<template>
  <div class="lcars-sidebar">
    <SidebarNav />
    <NewComponent variant="secondary">
      <p>This is the new component inside the sidebar!</p>
    </NewComponent>
    <SidebarFooter />
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import SidebarNav from '~/components/Sidebar/SidebarNav.vue';
import SidebarFooter from '~/components/Sidebar/SidebarFooter.vue';
import NewComponent from '~/components/UI/NewComponent.vue';
</script>
```

View Your New Component:

Start your development server (npm run dev), and navigate to the page where you added the new component to view it in action.

Adding a New Plugin
To add a new plugin to your Nuxt.js application, follow these steps:

Create the Plugin File:

Navigate to the plugins/ directory and create a new JavaScript file, e.g., new-plugin.js.

```bash
touch plugins/new-plugin.js
```

Add Plugin Logic:

Inside the new-plugin.js file, add your plugin logic:

```javascript
export default defineNuxtPlugin((nuxtApp) => {
  nuxtApp.provide('myPlugin', {
    sayHello() {
      console.log('Hello from myPlugin!');
    },
  });
});
```

Register the Plugin in nuxt.config.ts:

Update the nuxt.config.ts file to include the new plugin:

```typescript
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  plugins: [
    '~/plugins/new-plugin.js',
    // other plugins
  ],
});
```

Use the Plugin:

Use the plugin in your components or pages:

```vue
